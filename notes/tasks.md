# Task Notes
*Read [Cryptography & Security](cryptography.md) and [Proof of Performance](proof-of-performance.md) first.*
- Task format:
    - ID: A UUID generated by the task creator.
    - Requirements: A list of things need to complete the task.
        - Equipment: A list of required equipment for this task.
        - Location: A list of points that form the area a satellite must be in to complete the task.
        - Reputation: The reputation requirement for this task.
    - Type: The type of task.
    - Parameters: A list of parameters specific to the task.
    - Timestamp: When the task was created.
    - Deadline: When the task is due.
    - Requester: The public key of the requester.
    - Priority: A measure of how critical the task is.
    - Signature: A cryptographic signature that verifies where the task actually came from.

- Result format:
    - ID: A unique identifier generated by hashing the result along with the task.
    - Task ID: The ID of the task the result comes from.
    - Status: A status code representing the state of the result.
    - Payload: The actual output of the task, encrypted with the public key of the requester.
    - Signature: A cryptographic signature that verifies where the result actually came from.

- A task's weight, or real priority, can be calculated by looking at the task's initial priority, the time since creation, time until deadline, and the reputation of the requester.
The weight is how tasks are selection.
