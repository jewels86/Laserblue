# Cryptography & Security Notes
*Read [Proof of Performance](proof-of-performance.md) first.*
- Satellites can use Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) to generate a public/private key pair.
- Satellites can sign data with the public key, and other satellites can verify it with the public key.
- Satellites are also identified by their public keys.
