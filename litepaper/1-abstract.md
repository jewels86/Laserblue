# Laserblue: A Decentralized Proof-of-Performance Network for Autonomous Satellite Communication

## Abstract

Laserblue is a decentralized, cryptographically-secured network protocol designed to enable autonomous communication, collaboration, and reputation management between satellites operated by different nations, companies, and organizations.

Unlike traditional satellite networks, Laserblue imposes no central authority, no trust assumptions, and no structural dependencies between nodes. Every satellite maintains full autonomy, using cryptographic proofs and local computation to interact with the network securely and verifiably.

At its core, Laserblue combines several key mechanisms:
- Proof-of-performance task validation
- Decentralized reputation management through a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
- Lightweight behavioral fingerprinting
- Zero-knowledge task assignment
- Gossip-based message broadcasting
- Predictive path-based routing based on orbit summaries

Each node independently builds and maintains its own view of the network â€” a model that evolves through verifiable updates rather than assumptions or centralized broadcasts. Trust is earned, measured, and allowed to decay naturally over time.

Laserblue is designed for dynamic, scalable, tamper-resistant operation across low Earth orbit (LEO) and beyond. It enables satellites to coordinate effectively across political and corporate boundaries without revealing sensitive data, relying on centralized control points, or sacrificing operational independence.

## Key Features

**Proof of Performance (PoP):** Nodes earn reputation by completing verifiable, cryptographically signed tasks, validated by multiple independent participants.

**Decentralized Reputation DAG:** Each node maintains its own Directed Acyclic Graph of trust updates, applying cryptographic validation and natural decay functions to prevent stagnation or abuse.

**Behavioral Fingerprinting:** Nodes track peer stability and behavior over time using compact SimHash fingerprints derived from rolling state vectors.

**Task Assignment Without Coordination:** Fair and efficient task distribution is achieved through deterministic calculations based on public keys and global parameters, requiring no direct negotiation.

**Path-Based Predictive Routing:** Messages are forwarded through the network by matching orbit commitments, preserving location privacy while enabling efficient delivery.

**Gossip Propagation:** Messages spread through random peer-to-peer relays with cryptographic safeguards, ensuring robustness even under unpredictable topological changes.

Laserblue creates a self-sustaining, proof-driven ecosystem for space communication, where cooperation is not a matter of trust, but of verifiable performance.
