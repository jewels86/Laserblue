# Laserblue Litepaper
*A conceptual, Proof-of-Performance, decentralized satellite network protocol.*

**Laserblue** is an experimental satellite network prioritizing security, speed, and efficiency. 
It uses a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Performance, which ensures that the network stays continually optimized and secure by maintaining a task/reputation-based architecture. 

To achieve its goals, Laserblue incorporates a structured approach built on key foundational principles. 
Laserblue’s design is based on 3 main ideas:

### Minimal Trust Consensus
The network operates under the assumption that nodes do not have to inherently trust one another. 
Instead, it relies on cryptographic proofs, distributed validation, and reputation mechanisms so that each node independently verifies actions and data. 
Trust is not assumed-it must be earned and continuously validated.

### Performance-Based Incentives
Instead of granting privileges based on pre-existing trust or central authority, the network rewards nodes for demonstrating reliable performance. 
Nodes gain reputation by successfully completing verifiable tasks. 
Their credibility evolves based on metrics like accuracy and timeliness and is managed through mechanisms such as decay functions and behavioral fingerprinting.

### Autonomous, Context-Aware Coordination
The network is designed to be self-organizing and adaptive to the dynamic space environment. 
It uses projected orbital paths and location-based messaging to route communications effectively, taking into account real-time and predictive data. 

## Motivations
### Decentralization
Laserblue is designed to be as decentralized as possible. By distributing power among nodes, the network eliminates central points of failure, ensuring that no single node can take control of network operations.
Traditional networks are often hindered by centralization, where a few corporations or governments restrict access, limit resources, and create artificial scarcity of resources. 
This often leads to high costs, fees, and latency in the network.

### Cooperation
The network is meant to link satellites from any party together, so they may work together to accomplish their goals. 
This way, resources are shared between corporations, countries, and anyone else with a satellite.
By allowing satellites from different organizations to work together under a fair, performance-based system, the network fosters shared resource utilization, reduces redundancy, and enhances global accessibility—ensuring that space remains open, efficient, and resistant to monopolization.

## Technical Overview
Laserblue operates on a **Proof of Performance** (**PoP**) consensus mechanism. 
Proof of Performance is a task-based system that uses reputations as a measure of a node's credibility. 
Reputation increases as tasks are completed based on the accuracy, quality, and timeliness of the results.
