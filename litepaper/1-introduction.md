# Laserblue Litepaper
## A conceptual, Proof-of-Performance, decentralized satellite network protocol.
    **Laserblue** is an experimental satellite network prioritizing security, speed, and efficiency. It uses a new consensus mechanism called Proof of Performance, which ensures that the network stays continually optimized and secure by maintaining a task/reputation-based architecture. 
	
    To achieve its goals, Laserblue incorporates a structured approach built on key foundational principles. Laserblueâ€™s design is based on 3 main ideas:
