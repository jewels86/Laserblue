Designs and implementations for a conceptual, proof-of-performance decentralized satellite network.

## What is Laserblue?
**Laserblue** is an experimental satellite network concept prioritizing speed, security and performance. 

## How does this Repository Work?
This repository is a home base for the formation of the Laserblue concept. Currently, I'm designing out individual parts in the `notes` section. Feel free to read through any that seem interesting.

## How can I Contribute?
The best way to contribute to Laserblue is by reading through the designs and pointing out mistakes. 
You can also add to the designs in a pull request.
